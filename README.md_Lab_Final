### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Poulin12/Poulin12** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
The code pretty much runs it self.
It is all based on the motion sensor acting as the input to trigger both the lcd screen and led.
There is a delay between the input being detected and the light actually turning on and the same goes for the led and lcd to turn off.
The lcd is set up so when the value is in low it will display one image versus value high displaying another message.
